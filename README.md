# DATA-TYPES-IN-C-

AIM : To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

SOFTWARE USED : VS CODE 

Theory : The C++ program demonstrates the basic structure and usage of built-in data types by showcasing variable declaration, initialization, and output using cout. It utilizes fundamental data types such as int, float, double, char, and bool, each designed to store specific kinds of values like integers, decimal numbers, characters, and boolean values (true or false). These variables are initialized with values and then displayed to the user using output statements. Additionally, the sizeof operator is used to determine and display the amount of memory (in bytes) that each data type occupies, helping to understand how data is stored and managed in memory. This program provides a foundational understanding of how different data types behave in C++ programming.


Algorithm : 1. Start the program.

            2. Declare variables of different data types (int, float, double, char, bool).

            3. Assign values to each variable.

            4. Print the values and their memory sizes using cout and sizeof().

            5. End the program.
